GimmeMoarFrames
===============

a simple, but powerful registry tweak

simple, because you only have to merge 2 little registry entrys

powerful, because from now on arma3.exe and arma3server.exe are mapped in large page memory regions

try it out :)


(for the less experienced users: download the file 'GimmeMoarFrames.reg' -> right click -> merge)
